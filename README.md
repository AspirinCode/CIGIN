# CIGIN : Chemically Interpretable Graph Interaciton Network 
Official implementation of [CIGIN](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Chemically_Interpretable_Graph_Interaction_Network_for_Prediction_of_Pharmacokinetic_Properties_of_Drug-like_Molecules/10282346)


CIGIN is a chemically interpretable graph interaction network for prediction of pharmacokinetic properties of drug-like molecules.

#### Requirements:
- PyTorch
- Numpy 
- RDKit

#### Usage:
- Examples for prediction and analysis of interaction between solute and solvent atoms are given in the notebook. 
- Required scripts are given in the scripts folder.
- Trained model weight is provided in weights folder.
